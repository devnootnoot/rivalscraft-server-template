# Allow players to have multiple homes.
# Players need essentials.sethome.multiple before they can have more than 1 home.
# You can set the default number of multiple homes using the 'default' rank below.
# To remove the home limit entirely, give people 'essentials.sethome.multiple.unlimited'.
# To grant different home amounts to different people, you need to define a 'home-rank' below.
# Create the 'home-rank' below, and give the matching permission: essentials.sethome.multiple.<home-rank>
